# README for React-Node Template Project

## Introduction
This template project is designed to provide a foundational setup for building web applications using React and Node.js. It's tailored for developers looking to jump-start their project with a robust and well-structured base.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (Version 20.9.0)
- NPM (Node Package Manager)
- NVM (Node Version Manager) - Recommended for managing Node versions

## Setting Up
To get started with this template, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Node Version Management**
   - This project requires Node.js version 20.9.0. We recommend using NVM to manage Node versions.
   - There is a `.nvmrc` file included in the project root. Simply run `nvm use` in the terminal at the project root to switch to the correct Node version.

3. **Install Dependencies**
   - Navigate to both the React and Node project directories in separate terminal windows.
   - Run `npm install` in both directories to install the required dependencies.

## Running the Project
To run both the React and Node applications simultaneously on your machine, use the following command:

```npm run dev```

This command is configured to start both the React frontend and the Node backend concurrently. Make sure you are in the root directory of the project when running this command.
